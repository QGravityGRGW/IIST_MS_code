# Code for calculating the spectroscopic redshift by clicking on one particular emission/absorption line and then fitting the all the emission/absorption lines to the expected location using the determined redshift.
First code "galaxy_spectrum_new.py": to get the redshift by clicking on a particular emission/absorption line in the spectrum using user defined all the expected emission/absoption lines. Here you'll get a set of redshifts for all the user defined emission/absorption lines on the particular emission/absorption line where you clicked in the spetrum.
Second code "galaxy_spectrum_new_1.py": using the redshifts determined from "galaxy_spectrum_new.py" fitting all the user defined emission/absorption lines and check if the determined redshift is correct or not.
